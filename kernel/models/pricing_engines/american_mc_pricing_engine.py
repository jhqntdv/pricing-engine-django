    """A Monte Carlo pricing engine for American and Bermudan options using the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm.

    This engine uses least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) backward induction to determine the optimal early
    exercise strategy and compute the price of derivatives with early exercise features.

    # TBD (Future Enhancements):
    # 1. Dividend Support: The engine currently relies on the base stochastic process which does not natively 
    #    support continuous dividend yields (q) or discrete cash dividends. This is particularly important for 
    #    pricing American Call options, which are never optimally exercised early without a dividend yield.
    # 2. American Barrier Options: The backward induction loop does not currently check for barrier knock-outs. 
    #    Support needs to be added to zero out the continuation/immediate values for paths that breach a barrier.
